        "SpeciesSummary": "Armillaria gallica (synonymous with A. bulbosa and A. lutea) is a species of honey mushroom in the family Physalacriaceae of the order Agaricales. The species is a common and ecologically important wood-decay fungus that can live as a saprobe, or as an opportunistic parasite in weakened tree hosts to cause root or butt rot. It is found in temperate regions of Asia, North America, and Europe. The species forms fruit bodies singly or in groups in soil or rotting wood. The fungus has been inadvertently introduced to South Africa. Armillaria gallica has had a confusing taxonomy, due in part to historical difficulties encountered in distinguishing between similar Armillaria species. The fungus received international attention in the early 1990s when an individual colony living in a Michigan forest was reported to cover an area of 15 hectares (37 acres), weigh at least 9,500 kilograms (21,000 lb), and be 1,500 years old. This individual is popularly known as the \"humungous fungus\", and is a tourist attraction and inspiration for an annual mushroom-themed festival in Crystal Falls. Recent studies have revised the fungus's age to 2,500 years and its size to about 440 tons, four times the original estimate.Armillaria gallica is a largely subterranean fungus, and it produces fruit bodies that are up to about 10 cm (3.9 in) in diameter, yellow-brown, and covered with small scales. On the underside of the caps are gills that are white to creamy or pale orange. The stem may be up to 10 cm (3.9 in) long, with a white cobwebby ring that divides the color of the stem into pale orange to brown above, and lighter-colored below. The fungus can develop an extensive system of underground root-like structures, called rhizomorphs, that help it to efficiently decompose dead wood in temperate broadleaf and mixed forests. It has been the subject of considerable scientific research due to its importance as a plant pathogen, its ability to bioluminesce, its unusual life cycle, and its ability to form large and long-lived colonies."

        "SpeciesSummary": "Aureobasidium pullulans is a ubiquitous black, yeast-like fungus that can be found in different environments (e.g. soil, water, air and limestone). It is well known as a naturally occurring epiphyte or endophyte of a wide range of plant species (e.g. apple, grape, cucumber, green beans, cabbage) without causing any symptoms of disease. A. pullulans has a high importance in biotechnology for the production of different enzymes, siderophores and pullulan. Furthermore, A. pullulans is used in biological control of plant diseases, especially storage diseases.Chronic human exposure to A. pullulans via humidifiers or air conditioners can lead to hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic alveolitis) or \"humidifier lung\".  This condition is characterized acutely by dyspnea, cough, fever, chest infiltrates, and acute inflammatory reaction.  The condition can also be chronic, and lymphocyte-mediated. The chronic condition is characterized radiographically by reticulonodular infiltrates in the lung, with apical sparing. The strains causing infections in humans were reclassified to A. melanogenum.A. pullulans can be cultivated on potato dextrose agar, where it produces smooth, faint pink, yeast-like colonies covered with a slimy mass of spores. Older colonies change to black due to chlamydospore production. Primary conidia are hyaline, smooth, ellipsoidal, one-celled, and variable in shape and size; secondary conidia are smaller. Conidiophores are undifferentiated, intercalary or terminal, or arising as short lateral branches. Endoconidia are produced in an intercalary cell and released into a neighboring empty cell. Hyphae are hyaline, smooth, and thinwalled, with transverse septa. The fungus grows at 10\u201335 \u00b0C with optimum growth at 30 \u00b0C.\nA. pullulans is notable for its phenotypic plasticity. Colony morphology may be affected by carbon source, colony age, temperature, light and substrate, with colonies ranging from homogeneous to sectored, yeast-like to filamentous growth, and from small to large. These changes, potentially influenced by epigenetic factors, and the particular developmental sequences that the colonies proceed through may be observed with the naked eye. Besides these morphological plasticity A. pullulans is also adaptable to various stressful conditions: hypersaline, acidic and alkaline, cold, and oligotrophic. Therefore, it is considered to be polyextremotolerant.The morphology-based taxonomy of the species is complicated by the large morphological variability between strains and even within a single strain. Based on molecular analyses, four varieties of the species A. pullulans were recognised: var. pullulans from substrates with low water activity and the phyllosphere; var. melanogenum from aquatic habitats; var. subglaciale from glacial habitats; and var. namibiae, which was described on the basis of only one strain isolated from dolomitic marble in Namibia. However, when the genome sequences of these varieties became available, the differences between them were considered as too large to be accommodated in a single species. Therefore, the varieties were reclassified as new species: A. pullulans, A. melanogenum, A. subglaciale, and A. namibiae.Due to the relatively recent redefinition of the species, most published work does not yet distinguish between the new species belonging to the previously recognised A. pullulans species complex. It is therefore not clear to what extent this knowledge is valid for A. pullulans s. str. and what should be attributed to the three new species."

It has been reported on several hundred plant hosts and on all continents except Antarctica.  B. dothidea was redefined in 2004, and some reports of its host range from prior to that time likely include species that have since been placed in another genus.  Even so, B. dothidea has since been identified on a number of woody plants\u2014including grape, mango, olive, eucalyptus, maple, and oak, among others\u2014and is still expected to have a broad geographical distribution.  While it is best known as a pathogen, the species has also been identified as an endophyte, existing in association with plant tissues on which disease symptoms were not observed.  It can colonize some fruits, in addition to woody tissues.\n\n"

In viticulture, it is commonly known as \"botrytis bunch rot\"; in horticulture, it is usually called \"grey mould\" or \"gray mold\".\nThe fungus gives rise to two different kinds of infections on grapes. The first, grey rot, is the result of consistently wet or humid conditions, and typically results in the loss of the affected bunches. The second, noble rot, occurs when drier conditions follow wetter, and can result in distinctive sweet dessert wines, such as Sauternes or the Asz\u00fa of Tokaji/Gras\u0103 de Cotnari. The species name Botrytis cinerea is derived from the Latin for \"grapes like ashes\"; although poetic, the \"grapes\" refers to the bunching of the fungal spores on their conidiophores, and \"ashes\" just refers to the greyish colour of the spores en masse. The fungus is usually referred to by its anamorph (asexual form) name, because the sexual phase is rarely observed. The teleomorph (sexual form) is an ascomycete, Botryotinia fuckeliana, also known as Botryotinia cinerea (see taxonomy box)"

The disease can cause yield losses of up to 50% by causing death of tillers and reducing seed production and seed size. The disease causes broad yellow or brown stripes along the length of the leaf and discolouration of the leaf veins. The fungus spreads through the soil, and enters the plant through wounds in its roots. Early planting of winter wheat when the soil is warm gives a greater root system more subject to root breakage when the soil heaves affording more infection sites.  Phosphate fertilizer and high moisture further exacerbate this condition.  The symptoms are caused by the fungus invading the plants' vascular tissue. The fungus also produces a toxin which causes stunting of the plant and interferes with development.  A glucopolysaccharide also appears to inhibit fluid movement in wheat.Very little natural resistance to the disease is seen in wheat. Control measures include crop rotation for 2\u20133 years in areas where the disease has become a particular problem. Currently, no options exist for controlling the disease through the use of fungicides."

It is the cause of Cercospora leaf spot disease in sugar beets, spinach and swiss chard.  Of these hosts, Cercospora leaf spot is the most economically impactful in sugar beets (Beta vulgaris).  Cercospora beticola is a deuteromycete fungi that reproduces using conidia.  There is no teleomorph stage.  C. beticola is a necrotrophic fungi that uses phytotoxins specifically Cercospora beticola toxin (CBT) to kill infected plants.  CBT causes the leaf spot symptom and prevents root formation.  Yield losses from Cercospora leaf spot are around 20 percent.Hosts and Symptoms\nHosts of Cercospora beticola include sugar beets (Beta vulgaris), swiss chard (Beta vulgaris L. subsp. cicla) and other leafy greens.  Symptoms include the random distribution of spots with brownish red rings which eventually cause leaf collapse.Older leaves will have spots of larger diameters as rings grow outward.  conidia are not observable by the unaided eyeDisease Cycle\nStromata (a sclerotia like survival structure containing conidia when made) in field debris starts the life cycle. Under favorable wet conditions conidia are rain splashed and insect carried to new hosts where under humid and wet conditions they germinate and penetrate through stomata.  These conidia germinate in polycyclic microcycles until the end of the growing season.  At the end of the growing season C. beticola produces stromata again as a survival structure.  Microcycles like the one used by C. beticola are very effective at producing lots of conidia.  Because these conidia are effective at penetrating the host, mycelium is not necessary and conidia produce their own conidia at each new infection (microcycle).  There have been no direct observations of sexual spores in C. beticola.Management\nCopper was historically used to control C. beticola in the field though today fungicides are more common.  C. beticola has been shown to have some resistance to benzimidazole and thiophanate class fungicides.  As a result, experts often have recommended fungicide rotation to kill any potential fungicide resistant strains.  Some varieties of sugar beet also show resistance to C. beticola, unfortunately they have all had low yields in lab tests.  Today the most common fungicides used are QoI, Headline, Proline, Inspire SB, Eminent and Super Tin or Agri Tin"

The caps are white, and covered with scales\u2014this is the origin of the common names of the fungus. The gills beneath the cap are white, then pink, then turn black and secrete a black liquid filled with spores (hence the \"ink cap\" name). This mushroom is unusual because it will turn black and dissolve itself in a matter of hours after being picked or depositing spores.\nWhen young it is an excellent edible mushroom provided that it is eaten soon after being collected (it keeps very badly because of the autodigestion of its gills and cap). If long-term storage is desired, microwaving, sauteing or simmering until limp will allow the mushrooms to be stored in a refrigerator for several days or frozen. Also, placing the mushrooms in a glass of ice water will delay the decomposition for a day or two so that one has time to incorporate them into a meal. Processing or icing must be done whether for eating or storage within four to six hours of harvest to prevent undesirable changes to the mushroom. The species is cultivated in China as food.\nThe mushroom can sometimes be confused with the magpie fungus which is poisonous. In America, the 'vomiter' mushroom Chlorophyllum molybdites is responsible for most cases of mushroom poisoning due to its similarity with shaggy mane and other edible mushrooms."

For various Coriolopsis gallica strains isolated, it has been found, as a common feature of the division Basidiomycota, that they are able to degrade wood components, mainly lignin and to lesser extent cellulose, which results in a degradation area covered by the accumulating -white- cellulose powder, therefore, C. gallica might be generically called, as many other Basidiomycetes, as \"white-rot\" fungi.This feature of preferential degradation of lignin components, such as melanoidins, polyphenols, and other aromatic compounds is of biotechnological interest in the industries of paper (recycling and bleaching), beer and sugar cane production or for the bioremediation of waste waters produced in these and other industrial activities. While in Basidiomycota, the lignolytic activities are jointly played by enzymes such as laccases, manganese peroxidases and lignin peroxidases, in Coriolopsis gallica, as well as in the phylogenetically related Trametes spp., laccases (even in multiple genomic copies) are the main mechanisms involved in lignin modification, while in another well studied white-rot basidiomycota Phanerochaete spp., virtually no laccase activity is involved in lignin biodegradation.\n\n"

        "SpeciesSummary": "Cronartium ribicola  is a species of rust fungus in the family Cronartiaceae that causes the disease white pine blister rust.\nC. ribicola  is native to China, and was subsequently introduced to North America. Some European and Asian white pines (e.g. Macedonian Pine, Swiss Pine, Blue Pine) are mostly resistant to the disease, having co-evolved with the pathogen.\n\nIt was accidentally introduced into North America about 1900, where it is an invasive species causing serious damage to the American white pines, which have little genetic resistance. Mortality is particularly heavy in Western White Pine, Sugar Pine, Limber Pine and Whitebark Pine. Efforts are under way to select and breed the rare resistant individuals of these species; resistance breeding is concentrated at the United States Forest Service Dorena Genetic Resource Center in Oregon.\nSome limited silvicultural control of the disease is possible. If bark blisters are found on branches over 10\u201315 cm from the bole, those branches may be pruned off, which will stop the spread of the disease to the rest of that tree. If the main trunk is affected then no control is possible, and the tree will die once the infection encircles the tree. Infected trees are often identified by \"flagging\", when all the needles on a branch turn brown and die. Infections often occur on low branches close to the ground on young trees, so pruning of white pine can also be effective in multiple ways, as it improves the quality of timber by creating more knot-free timber, and reduces the likelihood of infection from the blister rust to a small extent. Another form of control practiced in some areas is to diligently remove Ribes plants from any area near white pines. Because the infection moves from currant plants, to pines, and back again, it cannot continue to exist without its alternate host. Although effective in theory, removal of currants is rarely successful in practice, as they readily re-grow from small pieces of root left in the soil, and the seeds are very widely spread in birds' droppings. According to the Southwest Oregon Forest Insect and Disease Service Center, white pine blister rust attacks all five needle pines. \"Damage [to plants] includes mortality, top kill, branch dieback, and predisposition to attack by other agents, including bark beetles\" [1]."

The color and size of this species can vary somewhat, but they are typically less than a centimeter wide and tall, and grey or brown in color. Another common name given to C. striatus, splash cups, alludes to the method of spore dispersal: the sides of the cup are angled such that falling drops of water can dislodge the peridioles and eject them from the cup.

As with other fungi the light spores are distributed globally and the fungi develop wherever conditions are suitable - it lives on dead and decaying wood, and is a common, widespread saprotroph.\nThe fungus is ball-shaped, with a hard, friable, shiny black fruiting body 2 to 7 centimeters wide. It resembles a chunk of coal, which gives it several of its common names, including coal fungus and carbon balls. According to legend, King Alfred once hid out in a countryside homestead during war, and was put in charge of removing baking from the oven when it was done. He fell asleep and the cakes burned. Daldinia concentrica is said to resemble a cake left to this fate.\nThe flesh of the fungus is purple, brown, or silvery-black inside, and is arranged in concentric layers. Most sources agree that like tree rings, these layers are related to seasonal growth. The asci are cylindrical and arranged inside the flask-shaped perithecium. When each ascus becomes engorged with fluid it extends outside the perithecium and releases spores.\nD. concentrica contains several unique compounds, including a purple polycyclic pigment and a metabolite called concentricol, which is oxidized squalene. Many types of insects and other small animals make their home inside this species of fungus."

        "SpeciesSummary": "Diaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae is a plant pathogen infecting soybean and peanut.\nDiaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae is the perfect form of the causal pathogen of pod and stem blight of soybean. It is a fungal ascomycete that commonly infects seeds, pods, stems, and petioles. This pathogen is also found in its imperfect state, Phomopsis sojae.  This is a common disease of most soybean growing regions in the United States. Losses result from losses in field stands, reductions in yield, and poor seed quality.Symptoms\nDiaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae can infect any aboveground parts of the plant; the disease may be present without showing any symptoms.Early-season infection typically takes place without showing any symptoms.\nMid-season symptoms appear as tiny black dots (pycnidia) on fallen leaves or abscised petioles.\nLate-season symptoms (pycnidia) appear on dead stems, branches and seed pods. Heavily infected seeds will often fail to germinate.\nVisual Symptoms include:\n\u2022\tLight brown spots on cotyledons or lower stems,\u2022\tSmall black dots (pycnidia) appear in rows along necrotic stem, branch, and petiole tissue (mature leaf tissue is not commonly infected),\u2022\tInfected seeds exhibiting: cracked seed coats, shriveling, flattening, grey mold, or black spots (pycnidia) on the seed coat.Hosts\n\tAlternate hosts include: \nLima bean, cowpea, snap beans, peanuts, lespedeza, lupine, pepper, tomato, okra, onion, and garlic.Environmental factors\n\tDiaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae is present throughout the world wherever soybeans are in production.  Conditions that favor this fungal infection include:\n\u2022\tA warm, wet, and humid growing season, particularly during pod development and maturation,\n\u2022\tContinuous soybean planting and infected seed,\u2022\tDelayed harvest, insect damage, and hail damage lead to seed infection.Disease cycle\n\tDiaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae (sexual) and Phomopsis sojae (asexual) overwinter as mycelia in infected seeds and plant debris. This serves as the primary inoculum.  In the spring, pycnidium are produced on plant debris and the petioles of abscise leaves. In the early summer perithecia develop on decaying stem tissue. \tThe perithecium contain asci while the pycnidium releases conidia. Spores will germinate and penetrate through primarily immature or wounded tissue. Spores need at least 24 hours of free moisture to cause infection. The spores can then spread into mycelium and form perithecia and pycnidia.\n\tMore progressive spread of disease can occur through secondary infection.  Secondary infections will occur when conidia are dispersed onto different parts of the by the splashing of water.Management\nHigh quality thoroughly cleaned seed and crop rotation are the primary controls of Diaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae.  Resistant varieties are available but not commonly used.\nProper seed treatments will protect seeds and increase stand count.  A higher stand count will lead to less branching and breaking of branches. Broken branches provide a point of entry for Diaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae. \nHarvesting soybeans at first maturity reduces the time of seed infection through the pod. Later maturing varieties tend to produce higher quality soybeans with less infection. When heavily inoculated plant debris is present, a deep tillage option can be taken to bury the residue."

The pathogen is responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide each year. Infection causes shifts in the amino acid composition of wheat, resulting in shriveled kernels and contaminating the remaining grain with mycotoxins, mainly deoxynivalenol, which inhibits protein biosynthesis; and zearalenone, an estrogenic mycotoxin. These toxins cause vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive defects in livestock, and are harmful to humans through contaminated food. Despite great efforts to find resistance genes against F. graminearum, no completely resistant variety is currently available. Research on the biology of F. graminearum is directed towards gaining insight into more details about the infection process and reveal weak spots in the life cycle of this pathogen to develop fungicides that can protect wheat from scab infection.\n\n"

Corn is affected in large numbers in the United States by this fungus, especially certain varieties that have been genetically engineered. These engineered varieties are more susceptible to the teleomorph phase of the fungus. It is not until the fungus moves to the teleomorph phase of the lifecycle and begins to produce fruiting bodies that host plants will begin to exhibit symptoms, often on plants depleted in energy after the stress of pollination. Once the pathogen is in a field, producers can suffer huge economic losses. The disease, corn anthracnose leaf blight, is the most common stalk disease in maize and occurs most frequently in reduced-till or no-till fields.

This is caused by light brown lesions, which in turn change the permeability of tuber skin and then it causes tuber shrinkage and water loss, which finally causes weight loss. The disease has become economically important because silver scurf affected potatoes for processing and direct consumption have been rejected by the industry. The disease cycle can be divided into two stages: field and storage. It is mainly a seed borne disease and the primary source of inoculum is mainly infected potato seed tubers. Symptoms develop and worsen in storage because the conditions are conducive to sporulation. The ideal conditions for the spread of this disease are high temperatures and high humidity. There are also many cultural practices that favor spread and development. Luckily, there are multiple ways to help control the disease."

It is now known that M. grisea consists of a cryptic species complex containing at least two biological species that have clear genetic differences and do not interbreed. Complex members isolated from Digitaria have been more narrowly defined as M. grisea.  The remaining members of the complex isolated from rice and a variety of other hosts have been renamed Magnaporthe oryzae. Confusion on which of these two names to use for the rice blast pathogen remains, as both are now used by different authors.\nMembers of the Magnaporthe grisea complex can also infect other agriculturally important cereals including wheat, rye, barley, and pearl millet causing diseases called blast disease or blight disease. Rice blast causes economically significant crop losses annually. Each year it is estimated to destroy enough rice to feed more than 60 million people.

According to Paul Stamets, it could be the answer to prevent colony collapse disorder and catastrophic famine.\nMany isolates have long been recognised to be specific, and they were assigned variety status, but they have now been assigned as new Metarhizium species, such as M. anisopliae, M. majus and M. acridum (which was M. anisopliae var. acridum and included the isolates used for locust control).  Metarhizium taii was placed in M. anisopliae var. anisopliae, but has now been described as a synonym of M. guizhouense (see Metarhizium).

It is one of the most readily recognized of all the edible mushrooms and highly sought after. Each fruit body begins as a tightly compressed, grayish sponge with lighter ridges, and expands to form a large yellowish sponge with large pits and ridges raised on a large white stem. The pitted yellow-brown caps measure 2\u20137 cm (0.8\u20132.8 in) broad by 2\u201310 cm (0.8\u20133.9 in) tall, and are fused to the stem at its lower margin, forming a continuous hollow. The pits are rounded and irregularly arranged. The hollow stem is typically 2\u20139 cm (0.8\u20133.5 in) long by 2\u20135 cm (0.8\u20132.0 in) thick, and white to yellow. The fungus fruits under hardwoods during a short period in the spring, depending on the weather, but it is also associated with old orchards, woods, disturbed grounds and burnt areas. Although a process was reported in 1982 to grow the fruit bodies under controlled conditions, attempts to cultivate the mushroom commercially have only been partially successful."

An extensive phylogenetic and nomenclatural study by Richard and colleagues in 2014, confirmed the status of Morchella vulgaris as a distinct species, and resolved several of its synonymities.This species is characterised by the predominantly grey colours of its cap and \"blistered\", highly irregular appearance of its ridges and pits."

Powdery mildew of mango is an Ascomycete pathogen of the Erysiphales family that was initially described by Berthet in 1914, using samples collected from Brazil. O. mangiferae is found in all areas where mangoes have been raised long term, but is particularly widespread in India where both the host and the pathogen are native. Currently no teleomorph stage has been identified, but due to certain morphological characteristics it has been suggested that O. mangiferae belongs in the Erysiphe polygony group. Mango is the only known host for this pathogen, though O. mangiferae appears to be identical to fungi responsible for powdery mildew diseases on various other plant species, particularly oak, though some differences may be observed. In particular, the number of cells in conidiophores varies from 2 on mango to 3-5 on oak. O. mangiferae has been known to infect oak leaves in the laboratory, however due to the lack of a known telemorph stage O. mangiferae is still considered to only be a pathogen of mango. Recent analysis of its ribosomal DNA suggests it is conspecific with Erysiphe alphitoides, the causative agent of powdery mildew in European oaks."

        "SpeciesSummary": "Ophiostoma ulmi is a species of fungus in the family Ophiostomataceae. It is one of the causative agents of Dutch Elm disease. It was first described under the name Graphium ulmi, and later transferred to the genus Ophiostoma.Dutch Elm Disease (DED) originated in Europe in the early 1900\u2019s. Elm trees were once an ecologically valuable tree that dominated mixed broadleaf forests, floodplains, and low areas near rivers and streams.They were planted in urban settings because of their aesthetic appeal and their ability to provide shade due to their V like shape.An outbreak of DED in the 1920\u2019s and again in the 1970\u2019s was responsible for the death of more than 40 million American Elms.Ophiostoma ulmi was the first known cause of DED. Since its discovery in 1910, new forms of the fungus, specifically Ophiostoma novo-ulmi, have emerged and appear to be more resistant to control measures and more aggressive in their infection.Host Range and Symptoms:\nOphiostoma ulmi has a relatively narrow host range as it only infects Elm trees (Ulmus spp.) and Zelkova carpinifolia. Habitat preferences of the Elm species play a large part in determining their susceptibility as a host for Dutch Elm Disease. For example, of the three native European Elm species (Ulmus glabra Huds., Ulmus laevis Pall. and Ulmus minor), all are susceptible to infection by O. ulmi, but Ulmus glabra has a much smaller chance of being inoculated than Ulmus minor. This is because the insect vector prefers the warm humid habitat of Ulmus minor to the cold hemiboreal habitat of Ulmus glabra. For this reason, Ulmus minor has been almost completely eliminated by the disease.  In North America, Ulmus americana, U. thomasii, U. alata, U. serotina and U. rubra are listed as highly susceptible to DED, while U. crassifolia is less threatened. Ophiostoma ulmi causes symptoms commonly associated with most vascular wilts. Trees that have been infected by a vector will exhibit symptoms of leaf wilting and yellowing on branches and twigs that have been colonized by the Scolytid beetle. These symptoms are most often apparent from July into the autumn months. Trees that have contracted the disease via root grafts will often proceed much more quickly because the whole tree is compromised at once. Diagnosis of this disease is usually done by examining the xylem tissue of twigs and branches of the trees. Symptoms of brown streaking that runs in the direction of the grain of the wood, and tylosis formation by the Elm as a reaction to the fungal infection are characteristic of this disease.Breeding efforts began as early as the 1920\u2019s to try to combat this disease, and some crosses bred from resistant Asian species of Elm and susceptible European species have shown a decrease in susceptibility to the pathogen.However, with the introduction of Ophiostoma novo-ulmi many of these resistant species struggle to survive.Environment:\nOphiostoma ulmi infects the bark and xylem tissue of Elm trees. It has been found in northern Africa and Oceania, but the vast majority of Elms that are or have been colonized by O. ulmi can be found in Europe, west central Asia, and North America. While there is some speculation as to how the disease traveled to North America, most experts agree that it was the fault of humans.\nIn the spring, trees produce what is known as \u201cspringwood\u201d from the stored starches of the previous growing season. This tissue is characterized by long xylem vessels with relatively thin walls, making it the ideal habitat for the pathogen. In springwood, the fungus will spread rapidly, and it is likely that the tree will die. Later in the growing season, the Elm will utilize sugars produced by the leaves to nurture the formation of \u201csummerwood\u201d. Summerwood vessels are typically shorter with thicker walls, making it harder for the infection to spread.The pathogen enters its host with assistance from the Scolytid beetle, and will colonize the tunnels, or breeding galleries, made by the insect. The greatest impact of this disease is seen in urban settings and in trees that have previously been impaired by drought or insects.O. ulmi prefers a subtropical climate for sporulation, with optimal temperatures between 27.5\u2103 and 30\u2103 and high moisture, which has largely limited the pathogen\u2019s reach in high altitudes and northern latitudes. The formation of other structures can tolerate cooler environments. Conidia will form at or around 20\u2103, while perithecia form at 8-10\u00b0C. Subjection to high summer temperatures combined with low moisture content and ensuing low nutrient levels in the bark of Elm trees greatly restricts sporulation of the fungi. Because of this, it is common that the fungus will avoid branches with small diameters and localize in areas with thick bark, high moisture, and abundant nutrients.Chemical control of this disease through insecticides and fungicides has not proven successful in the past and is often expensive. Many communities have adopted cultural practices to help manage the spread of this disease. This includes sanitation, avoiding planting Elm monocultures and breaking root grafts between Elms.Disease Cycle:\nOphiostoma ulmi can reproduce asexually by overwintering in both the bark and upper layers of dead or dying Elm wood as mycelia and synnemata. Synnemata produce conidia that are sticky and can be spread by vectors. In Dutch Elm Disease, the vectors that transmit Ophiostoma ulmi are Scolytid beetles. The conidia stick to the bodies of adult beetles and are spread throughout the tunnels (galleries) the beetle makes as it eats. Once in a tunnel, the spores will germinate to produce mycelium. During the late winter months and early spring mycelium spread rapidly. At the same time, the fungus secretes enzymes that break down the cell walls of the tree and allow the mycelium to grow into the xylem tissue. Here, it will release millions of conidia that travel with the xylem sap.As the fungus grows it creates blockages in the vascular system of the tree, causing the characteristic symptom of wilting in the leaves. As new beetles bore through the xylem tissue, they come into contact with conidia in the sap which sticks to their bodies and can be transmitted to other trees that they feed on. The disease can also be spread if mature roots of an infected tree graft to another tree and the conidia travel through xylem sap to the new host.It can also reproduce sexually. O. ulmi is a heterothallic ascomycete disease with mating types A and B. When these mating types are present in the same host, ascospores will be produced inside of a perithecia. The perithecia can form singly or in large groups, and typically will have a long neck like structure with a black ball at the top. This ball contains the asci and ascospores. Once they are mature, the ascospores will be released from an opening in the perithecia in a sticky liquid that can attach to the body of the Scolytid beetle and be spread throughout the host or to new hosts."

Systemically infected plants are dwarfed and pale green. Under moist conditions, the pathogen sporulates on the affected tissues and spreads to other plants, on the leaves and stalks of which it forms greyish-violet local lesions. Infected leaves are often entirely killed. Critical periods for infection have been determined. Infected crops yield poorly, and produce distorted bulbs.  Control is by crop rotation (at least 3 years between successive onion crops), use of healthy bulbs for planting (heat treatment has been used to eliminate the pathogen from bulbs), fungicide treatment of the bulbs for planting, and fungicide sprays of the foliage if downy mildew infection is nevertheless observed."

It causes downy mildew on leaves of wild and cultivated Amaranthaceae: Amaranthus, Atriplex, Bassia, Beta, Chenopodium, Halimione, Salsola, Spinacia, etc. In the past, the forms of Peronospora on these different genera, and their species, were given different species names, but these downy mildews are now generally considered to be forms of one species, P. farinosa (see Index Fungorum). Some of the forms on important crop plants have been given names as formae speciales, notably f.sp. betae on sugar beet (= P. schachtii) and f.sp. spinaciae on spinach. Such host specialization possibly also exists with respect to the various wild amaranthaceous hosts of P. farinosa.\nDowny mildew is a moderately important disease of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris). The pathogen persists as oospores in the soil, or on beet seed crops, or on overwintered volunteer beet plants. Attacks are most important at the seedling stage. The cotyledons are systemically infected, becoming discoloured and distorted. Loss of seedlings causes uneven crop development. Beet leaves are less affected, so a crop can to a substantial effect recover from an attack on seedlings. Control relies on adequate crop rotation and avoidance of sources of infection (e.g. adequate control of the disease on beet seed crops), as oospores survive only 2\u20133 years in the soil. Individual infected plants may also be removed. It is not generally necessary to apply fungicides.Downy mildew has more direct importance on spinach (Spinacia oleracea), since it affects the harvested part (leaves). Yellow lesions appear on the older leaves. If rotating crops and removing individual infected plants fails, fungicide treatments are effective, and resistant cultivars are available."

The fungus causes yellowing (chlorosis) of the needles, with eventual necrosis and premature needle-drop. In some heavily diseased stands of trees, the only needles remaining are those of the current year, in which the disease has not yet had time to fully develop.

P. schweinitzii is a polypore, although unlike bracket fungi the fruiting body may appear terrestrial when growing from the roots or base of the host tree.  The fruiting bodies, appearing in late summer or fall, commonly incorporate blades of grass, twigs, or fallen pine needles as they grow.  As these fruiting bodies age, the pore surface turns from yellow to greenish yellow, the top becomes darker, and the flesh becomes harder and more wood-like.The effect, impact and significance of infection by this fungus is rooted in the fact that it causes brown rot, which degrades the cellulose.  Thus there is a loss of tensile strength which often leads to brittle fracture near the stem base, even at a fairly early stage of decay.  Decay initiated above ground can lead to branch snap or breakout.P. schweinitzii is native to North America and Eurasia, and has been identified as an exotic species in New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa.As its common name suggests, the dyer's polypore is an excellent natural source of green, yellow, gold, or brown dye, depending on the material dyed and the mordant used.P. schweinitzii is named after Lewis David de Schweinitz, a Pennsylvania-born Moravian minister and important early American mycologist."

Common symptoms caused by the pathogen begin as small circular reddish-purple spots and enlarge to form V-shaped lesions that follow the vasculature of the plant\u2019s leaves. Although the fungus infects leaves early in the growing season when the plants are beginning to develop, leaf blight symptoms are most apparent on older plants towards the end of the growing season. The disease can weaken strawberry plants through the destruction of foliage, which results in reduced yields. In years highly favorable for disease development, leaf blight can ultimately lead to the death of the strawberry plants. A favorable environment for the growth and development of the Phomopsis obscurans pathogen is that of high temperature, high inoculum density, a long period of exposure to moisture, and immature host tissue. In the case of disease management, a conjunction of cultural practices is the most effective way of reducing the infection."

This is a prevalent disease in most soybean growing regions, and a major cause of crop loss. In wet conditions the pathogen produces zoospores that move in water and are attracted to soybean roots. Zoospores can attach to roots, germinate, and infect the plant tissues. Diseased roots develop lesions that may spread up the stem and eventually kill the entire plant. Phytophthora sojae also produces oospores that can remain dormant in the soil over the winter, or longer, and germinate when conditions are favourable. Oospores may also be spread by animals or machinery.Phytophthora sojae is a diploid organism with a genome size of 95 Mbp (Millions of base pairs).The natural chemical farinomalein (a metabolite from entomopathogenic fungus Paecilomyces farinosus) has shown potent and selective inhibition (0.15-5 \u03bcg/disk) against eight isolates of plant pathogenic Phytophthora sojae. These results suggest that farinomalein might be useful as a candidate pesticide for the treatment of Phytophthora stem rot in soybean.Phytophthora sojae is so similar to Phytophthora megasperma that they\u2019re often mistaken for each other. In the early years of research, Phytophthora sojae and Phytophthora medicaginis were respectively known as Phytophthora megasperma f. sp. glycines and Phytophthora megasperma f. sp. medicaginis.

In most years the disease is an annual, late-season problem on squash and pumpkin in the eastern and central United States, however, since 2004 it has become one of the most important diseases in cucumber production.  Considered a highly destructive foliar disease of cucurbits, successful breeding in the mid-twentieth century provided adequate control of downy mildew in cucumber without the use of fungicides. The resurgence in virulence has caused growers great concern and substantial economic losses, while downy mildew in other cucurbit crops continues to be a yearly hindrance."

It is an autoecious fungus, meaning that all stages of its life cycle \u2013 pycniospores, aeciospores, and teliospores \u2013 all develop upon the same host plant\n\n. Rust diseases are among the most destructive plant diseases, known to cause famine following destruction of grains, vegetables, and legumes. Asparagus rust occurs wherever the plant is grown and attacks asparagus plants during and after the cutting season. Asparagus spears are usually harvested before extensive rust symptoms appear. Symptoms are first noticeable on the growing shoots in early summer as light green, oval lesions, followed by tan blister spots and black, protruding blisters later in the season. The lesions are symptoms of Puccinia asparagi during early spring, mid-summer and later summer to fall, respectively. Severe rust infections stunt or kill young asparagus shoots, causing foliage to fall prematurely, and reduce the ability of the plant to store food reserves. The Puccinia asparagi fungus accomplishes this by rust lowering the amounts of root storage metabolites. The infected plant has reduced plant vigor and yield, often leading to death in severe cases. Most rust diseases have several stages, some of which may occur on different hosts; however, in asparagus rust all the life stages (orange spore in spring, red spore in summer, and black spore in autumn and winter) occur on asparagus. Because of this, many observers mistake the different stages of the Puccinia asparagi life cycle as the presence of different diseases. The effects of Puccinia asparagi are present worldwide wherever asparagus is being grown. Asparagus rust is a serious threat to the asparagus industry.\n\n"

It is a relatively new disease of barley in North America.  It was first found in 1992 in a barley breeding nursery near Clay Center, Nebraska. Since then, crown rust has been found throughout the upper Midwest, with greatest incidence in the central Red River Valley of North Dakota and Minnesota. In that region the alternate host, common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica), grows abundantly in shelter belts and riparian areas. Since 1993, outbreaks of crown rust have occurred on barley and forage grasses at several localities in this region. The extent of yield losses in barley caused by this disease have not been determined. Crown rust posed a threat to barley production, because the first infections in barley occur early in the season from local inoculum. Crown rusts have evolved many different physiological races within different species in response to host resistance. Each pathogenic race can attack a specific line of plants within the species typical host. For example, there are over 290 races of P. coronata. Crops with resistant phenotypes are often released, but within a few years virulent races have arisen and P. coronata can infect them."

The pathogen causes a disease originally named yellow spot but now commonly called tan spot, yellow leaf spot, yellow leaf blotch or helminthosporiosis. At least eight races of the pathogen are known to occur based on their virulence on a wheat differential set.The tan (yellow) spot fungus was first described by Nisikado in 1923 in Japan . and was later identified in Europe, Australia and the USA, in the mid 1900s. There lies the possibility that the fungus was spread with the introduction of dwarf wheat which also originated from the same area of Japan and introduced around the world at the same time. The disease is one of the most important fungal disease on wheat and the fungal pathogen is found to infect in all parts of the world wherever wheat and other susceptible host crops are found. P. tritici-repentis overwinters on stubble, and due to recent heavily no-till/residue retention cultural practices, increased incidence and yield loss of up to 49% has been witnessed if ideal conditions occur. It forms characteristic, dark, oval-shaped spots of necrotic tissue surrounded by a yellow ring. It is responsible for losses that account for up to 30% of the crop, due to its effects reducing photosynthesis. Pathogenesis and toxicity in P. tritici-repentis is controlled by a single gene, transformations of this gene cause the pathogen to become benign when interacting with wheat. This has major implications for those in agriculture seeking to combat the effects of this fungus.\n\n"

        "SpeciesSummary": "Rhizoctonia solani (teleomorph: Thanatephorus cucumeris) is a plant pathogenic fungus with a wide host range and worldwide distribution. It was discovered more than 100 years ago. R. solani frequently exists as thread-like growth on plants or in culture, and is considered a soil-borne pathogen. R. solani is best known to cause various plant diseases such as collar rot, root rot, damping off, and wire stem. R. solani attacks its hosts when they are in their early stages of development, such as seeds and seedlings, which are typically found in the soil.  The pathogen is known to cause serious plant losses by attacking primarily the roots and lower stems of plants. Although it has a wide range of hosts, its main targets are herbaceous plants. R. solani would be considered a basidiomycete fungus if the teleomorph stage were more abundant. The pathogen is not currently known to produce any asexual spores (conidia), though it is considered to have an asexual lifecycle. Occasionally, sexual spores (basidiospores) are produced on infected plants.  The disease cycle of R. solani is important in management and control of the pathogen.\n\n"

It is believed that the disease developed in Florida in the early twentieth century and is related to citrus scab, Elsinoe fawcetti. Since then, S.perseae has spread to many regions worldwide that support cultivation of the avocado tree. This pathogen threatens the global avocado market, including both importers and exporters of the crop.

It stunts the growth of the plants and leaves smut balls in the grain heads. When the grain is milled the smut balls emit a fishy odor that lowers the quality of the flour.\nTCK smut exists in the western and northwestern United States, but is not considered a major problem. The disease took on policy significance because China applied a zero tolerance on the presence of TCK spores, resulting in a ban from 1974 to 1999 on shipments from the Pacific Northwest. Until the summer of 1996, China accepted shipments of U.S. wheat from the Gulf Coast, and negotiated price discounts with the shippers to cover the cost of decontamination if traces of TCK were found. Then in June 1996, China rejected all cargoes of U.S. wheat with traces of TCK. The November 1999 U.S.-China Agricultural Cooperation Agreement removes the ban and allows imports of U.S. wheat and other grains that meet a specific TCK tolerance level, thus improving the competitiveness of U.S. wheat with Canadian and Australian exports."

        "SpeciesSummary": "Ustilaginoidea virens, perfect sexual stage Villosiclava virens, is a plant pathogen which causes the disease False Smut of rice which reduces both grain yield and grain quality. The disease occurs in more than 40 countries, especially in the rice producing countries of Asia. but also in the U.S. As the common name suggests, it is not a true smut (fungus), but an ascomycete. False smut does not replace all or part of the kernel with a mass of black spores, rather sori form erupting through the palea and lemma forming a ball of mycelia, the outermost layers are spore-producing. Infected rice kernels are always destroyed by the disease.\nOf particular concern are the production of alkaloids in the grain as with the Claviceps spp. causing ergot\nDisease Cycle\nU. virens has a peculiar life cycle. White hyphae are produced by the fungi after initial infection of the floral organs of the rice crop. As the infection matures with time, darker brownish green chlamydospores are produced on the rice spikelets. Additionally, sclerotia can be present towards the end of the fall season. During its life cycle, U. virens undergoes a sexual (ascospores) stage as well as an asexual (chlamydospores) stage. The chlamydospores are the main survival structure, and they can live in the soil for up to four months. The additional formation of sclerotia allows U. virens to survive even longer, almost up to a year. These sclerotia, which can be present either on or below the surface of the soil, mature to form an ascocarp (fruiting body). The ascospores from these fruiting bodies act as the primary source of infection to spread disease throughout the paddy field.\nInfection\nThe rice false smut pathogen, Ustilaginoidea virens, invades through small gap at the apex of a rice spikelet before heading. The primary source of infection is the presence of chlamydospores in the soil (Ikegami, 1963). During the vegetative stage of the growth of the rice crop, the fungus colonizes the tissue on the growing points on the tillers (Ikegami, 1963). This happens when conidia get deposited on the spikelets of the rice crop, which later lead to the growth of hyphae. The mycelia from these hyphae invade the floral organs in the spikelets. \nDisease Control\nThe rice false smut pathogen causes mostly qualitative damage to the rice crop. Removal of the brown \u201csmut balls\u201d is important to maintain the visual integrity of the harvested crop. Additionally, certain steps can be taken to manage and/ or prevent the onset of disease. Most rice varieties are susceptible to the disease; however, some cultivars of rice provide a small amount of resistance against U. virens (Cartwright, 2002). Planting rice earlier in the season can also reduce the amount of disease caused by false smut. In some studies, rice planted in April showed much less presence of false smut than rice planted after the 15th of May. As is the case for most rice diseases, large amounts of fertilizer in the soil lead to increase in disease (Cartwright, 2002). Maintaining the nitrogen rate in the soil to a level below 160 pounds per acre has proven to be most efficient against stopping disease (Cartwright, 2002). Although there are no specific fungicide recommendations for the eradication of the false smut pathogen of rice, Cartwright reported that propiconazole was the most effective ingredient after studying it for over three years."

        "SpeciesSummary": "Ustilago avenae is a plant pathogen. Semiloose smut of oats can be found wherever oats are grown, as they are seldom treated with seed treatments. The level of treatment is low because oats command a lower sale price than other cereals and hence it is thought that treatment is uneconomic. Semiloose smut of oats, unlike loose smut of wheat and barley, can thus infect up to 80 per cent of a crop.\nAs with wheat and barley the grains of semiloose smut infected oat plants are completely replaced by the smut fungus. It is not evident until heads emerge and is very difficult to distinguish from covered smut."

It is a common inhabitant of forest and woodland areas, usually growing from the bases of rotting or injured tree stumps and decaying wood. It has also been known to colonize substrates like woody legume pods, petioles, and herbaceous stems. It is characterized by its elongated upright, clavate, or strap-like stromata poking up through the ground, much like fingers. The genus Xylaria contains about 100 species of cosmopolitan fungi. Polymorpha means \"many forms\". As its name suggests, it has a very variable but often club-shaped fruiting body (stroma) resembling burned wood.\nOften this fungus is found with a multitude of separate \"digits\" but at times the individual parts will be fused together.\n\nBelonging to the class of fungus known as Ascomycetes (division Mycota) known as the sac fungi, they are characterized by a saclike structure, the ascus, which contains anything from four to eight ascospores in the sexual stage. The sac fungi are separated into subgroups based on whether asci arise singly or are borne in one of several types of fruiting structures, or ascocarps, and on the method of discharge of the ascospores. Many ascomycetes are plant pathogens, some are animal pathogens, a few are edible mushrooms, and many live on dead organic matter (as saprobes). The largest and most commonly known ascomycetes include the morel and the truffle, however the polymorpha is an inedible variety.\nThe dark fruiting body (often black or brown, but sometimes shades of blue/green) is surprisingly white on the inside, with a blackened dotted area all around. This blackened surrounding area is made up of tiny structures called perithecia. The perithecia hold a layer of asci which contain the ascospores. The asci elongate into the ostiole, and discharge the ascospores outward. The spore distribution is a lengthy process, sometimes taking several months to complete this part of the life cycle, this is not a common trait amongst fungi, as is normally a much swifter process.\nIn springtime this fungus often produces a layer of white or bluish asexual spores called conidia, which grow on its surface and surrounding area."

        "SpeciesSummary": "Amanita muscaria, commonly known as the fly agaric or fly amanita, is a basidiomycete of the genus Amanita. It is also a muscimol mushroom. Native throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, Amanita muscaria has been unintentionally introduced to many countries in the Southern Hemisphere, generally as a symbiont with pine and birch plantations, and is now a true cosmopolitan species. It associates with various deciduous and coniferous trees. Arguably the most iconic toadstool species, the fly agaric is a large white-gilled, white-spotted, usually red mushroom, and is one of the most recognisable and widely encountered in popular culture.Although classified as poisonous, reports of human deaths resulting from its ingestion are extremely rare. After parboiling - which weakens its toxicity and breaks down the mushroom's psychoactive substances - it is eaten in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Amanita muscaria is noted for its hallucinogenic properties, with its main psychoactive constituents being the compounds ibotenic acid and muscimol. The mushroom was used as an intoxicant and entheogen by the peoples of Siberia, and has a religious significance in these cultures. There has been much speculation on possible traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant in other places such as the Middle East, Eurasia, North America, and Scandinavia."

        "SpeciesSummary": "Psilocybe cyanescens (sometimes referred to as wavy caps or as the potent Psilocybe) is a species of potent psychedelic mushroom. The main compounds responsible for its psychedelic effects are psilocybin and psilocin. It belongs to the family Hymenogastraceae. A formal description of the species was published by Elsie Wakefield in 1946 in the Transactions of the British Mycological Society, based on a specimen she had recently collected at Kew Gardens. She had begun collecting the species as early as 1910. The mushroom is not generally regarded as being physically dangerous to adults. Since all the psychoactive compounds in P. cyanescens are water-soluble, the fruiting bodies can be rendered non-psychoactive through parboiling, allowing their culinary use. However, since most people find them overly bitter and they are too small to have great nutritive value, this is not frequently done."
