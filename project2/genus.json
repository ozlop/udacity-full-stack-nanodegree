Most species are harmless saprobes, and are relatively abundant members of the soil microbial community. Some species produce mycotoxins in cereal crops that can affect human and animal health if they enter the food chain. The main toxins produced by these Fusarium species are fumonisins and trichothecenes. Despite most species apparently being harmless, some Fusarium species and subspecific groups are among the most important fungal pathogens of plants and animals. \nThe name of Fusarium comes from Latin fusus, meaning a spindle.\n\n"

It includes about 10 species formerly categorized summarily as A. mellea.  Armillarias are long-lived and form some of the largest living organisms in the world. The largest known organism (of the species Armillaria solidipes) covers more than 3.4 square miles (8.8 km2) in Oregon's Malheur National Forest and is more than 2,400 years old. Some species of Armillaria display bioluminescence, resulting in foxfire.\nArmillaria can be a destructive forest pathogen. It causes \"white rot\" root disease (see Plant Pathology section) of forests, which distinguishes it from Tricholoma, a mycorrhizal (non-parasitic) genus. Because Armillaria is a facultative saprophyte, it also feeds on dead plant material, allowing it to kill its host, unlike parasites that must moderate their growth to avoid host death.In the Canadian Prairies (particularly Manitoba), Armillaria is referred to often as pidpenky (Ukrainian: \u043f\u0456\u0434\u043f\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438), meaning \u201cbeneath the stump\u201d in Ukrainian.\n\n"

        "GenusSummary": "The exosporium is the outer surface layer of mature spores. In plant spores it is also referred to as the exine. Some bacteria also produce endospores with an exosporium, of which the most commonly studied are Bacillus species, particularly Bacillus cereus and the anthrax-causing bacterium Bacillus anthracis. The exosporium is the portion of the spore that interacts with the environment or host organism, and may contain spore antigens. Exosporium proteins, such as Cot protein, are also discovered related to strains of B. anthracis and B.cereus. This Cot protein share similar sequences with other spore coat proteins, and their putative determinants are believed to include bxpC, lunA, exsA, etc.In Bacillus anthraces, salt and detergent washing of exosporium fragments can identify proteins that are likely to represent structural or integral exosporium proteins. Seven proteins have been identified in washed exosporium: alanine racemase, inosine hydrolase, ExsF, CotY, ExsY, CotB, and a novel protein, ExsK. CotY, ExsY and CotB are homologues of Bacillus subtilis outer spore coat proteins, but ExsF and ExsK are specific to B. anthracis and other members of the Bacillus cereus group.The protein ywdL has been identified in B. cereus as important for exosporium formation. In the absence of the ywdL gene, a fragile and easily damaged exosporium is formed, which can be damaged by mechanical disruption such as freeze-thaw cycles. However, ywdL is not required to maintain the internal organization of the exosporium. \u0394ywdL spores have abnormal germination properties, such as the inability to respond to standard chemical means of inducing germination by treatment with calcium dipicolinate.\n\n"

        "GenusSummary": "Mycosphaerella is a genus of ascomycota. With more than 10,000 species, it is the largest genus of plant pathogen fungi.\nThe following introduction about the fungal genus Mycosphaerella is copied (with permission) from the dissertation of Dr. W. Quaedvlieg (named: Re-evaluating Mycosphaerella and\nallied genera), publicly available at http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/308485\nSpecies belonging to the fungal genus Mycosphaerella (1884) (Capnodiales, Dothideomycetes) have evolved as endophytes, saprotrophs and symbionts, but mostly Mycosphaerella\nspecies are foliicolous plant pathogens which are the cause of significant economical losses in\nboth temperate and tropical crops worldwide. The generic concept of Mycosphaerella is based on the type species of the genus, M. punctiformis, which was introduced\n130 years ago in order to describe small loculoascomycetes with few distinct morphological\ntraits. Species belonging to Mycosphaerella were characterised as having pseudothecial ascomata that can be immersed or superficial, embedded in host tissue or erumpent, having ostiolar periphyses, but lacking interascal tissue at maturity. Ascospores are hyaline, but in some\ncases slightly pigmented and predominantly 1-septate, although taxa with 3-septate asco\nspores have been recorded. This description appears to be quite distinctive, but is in fact very\nbroad and actually lead to 120 years of confusion in which the generic name Mycosphaerella\nwas being used as a dumping ground for small loculoascomycetes with few distinct morpho\nlogical traits. In the 19th and 20th centuries, thousands of species and infrasprecific taxa were\ndescribed in the genus Sphaerella, only to have the entire genus and about 1000 additional\nspecies redescribed into the genus Mycosphaerella at the end of the 20th century.\nThe identification of Mycosphaerella species by morphological means is extremely difficult as\nthese taxa produce very small fruiting structures with highly conserved morphologies, tending\nto grow and sporulate poorly in culture and for over 120 years, identification was\nbased on morphology alone. These identification difficulties are amplified by the fact that up\nto six different species can inhabit the same lesion as either a primary or secondary pathogen, making even host-specific species difficult to identify. The\nintroduction of affordable sequencing technology during the first decade of the 21st century\nallowed for much more accurate species delimitation and phylogenetic elucidation, leading to\nthe conclusion that the broad taxonomic description of the genus Mycosphaerella and a lack of\nclear morphological features led to many Mycosphaerella and mycosphaerella-like species being misidentified. Because the classic taxonomic description of Mycosphaerella is broad and includes\nso many mycosphaerella-like species, the traditional generic concept of Mycosphaerella will\nhereafter be referred to as Mycosphaerella sensu lato (s. lat.) in order to avoid confusion.\nCurrently more than 3 000 species and close to 10 000 names are associated with Mycosphaerella s. lat., but work by Verkley et al. (2004) revealed that the genus\nMycosphaerella s. str. (based on M. punctiformis) was in fact limited to species with Ramularia\nasexual morphs. Research by Braun (1990, 1998) showed that there are only about 500 Ramularia species known from literature, leaving the majority of mycosphaerella-like species that\nwill need to be reclassified into taxonomically correct genera and families. Since the advent of\nmass sequencing technology, 39 taxonomically correct genera have already been confirmed\nas belonging to the Mycosphaerellaceae via molecular means:\n(Amycosphaerella, Neopseudocercospora, Ramularia, Caryophylloseptoria, Neoseptoria, Ramulispora, Cercospora, Pallidocercospora, Ruptoseptoria, Cercosporella, Paracercospora, Scolecostigmina, Colletogloeum, Paramycosphaerella, Septoria, Cytostagonospora, Passalora*, Sonderhenia, Distocercospora, Periconiella, Sphaerulina, Dothistroma, Phaeophleospora, Stenella, Lecanosticta, Phloeospora, Stromatoseptoria, Microcyclosporella, Polyphialoseptoria, Trochophora, Neodeightoniella, Polythrincium, Xenomycosphaerella, Neomycosphaerella, Pseudocercospora, Zasmidium, Neopenidiella, Pseudocercosporella* and Zymoseptoria)\n\nThe genera Passalora and Pseudocercosporella are known to be paraphyletic and will be treated separately in the near future.Although at least 25 more genera with postulated Mycosphaerellaceae affinity have yet to be confirmed.\nThe current generic and family concepts of both Mycosphaerella s. str., the Mycosphaerellaceae and the Teratosphaeriaceae have evolved indirectly from the work of Crous (1998), who\nused culture and asexual morphological characteristics to show that Mycosphaerella s. lat.\nwas in fact polyphyletic, suggesting that it should be subdivided into natural genera as defined\nby its asexual morphs. In contrast to these findings, the first sequence-based phylogenetic trees published for Mycosphaerella s. lat. (based mainly on ITS nrDNA sequence data), suggested that Mycosphaerella was monophyletic. However, as more sequence data of Mycosphaerella spp. became available (especially of loci such as the 28S nrDNA), the view of Mycosphaerella s. lat. as being\nmonophyletic has gradually shifted and there is now ample evidence that Mycosphaerella in\nits broadest sense is polyphyletic. Since this discovery was made, the original\nconserved generic concept of Mycosphaerella s. lat. has been replaced with the concept that\nthe mycosphaerella-like morphology has evolved multiple times and that these taxa in fact\ncluster in diverse families such as the Cladosporiaceae, Dissoconiaceae, Mycosphaerellaceae and Teratosphaeriaceae.\nAs such, the name Mycosphaerella should be limited to species with Ramularia sexual forms, but the name Ramularia actually predates the name Mycosphaerella, so the name Ramularia has preference over Mycosphaerella, and will be placed on the list of protected names."

Since Coprinus comatus is the type species of Coprinus, only that species and its close relatives C. sterquilinus and C. spadiceisporus retained the name of the genus.The majority of species of Coprinus were therefore reclassified into three genera placed in Psathyrellaceae: Coprinellus, Coprinopsis, and Parasola.

However, most members of this genus are small, unimpressive brown mushrooms.  Their humble appearance contributes to their not being readily distinguishable to non-specialists, and they are therefore seldom collected by mushroom hunters.  Several of the species are known to grow in the characteristic fairy ring pattern.\n\nThe author of the genus was Elias Magnus Fries, who in 1838 classified white-spored agarics having a tough central stipe in this taxon if they were marcescent, i.e. they could dry out, but later revive when moistened. For Fries, marcescence (by contrast with the \"putrescent\" (decomposing) nature of most mushrooms) was an important character for classification, which he used to separate this group from genus Collybia (which has now been split into many newer genera).  The name Marasmius itself comes from a Greek word marasmos, meaning \"drying out\".  Modern mycologists no longer consider the marcescence/putrescence distinction a reliable criterion for taxonomy, but Fries's definition of the genus is still roughly applicable."

Additionally, the conidia of Geosmithia do not have a green color, in contrast to the characteristic blue-grey or green-grey conidia of Penicillium. Some Geosmithia species have teleomorphic forms that are classified in the genus Talaromyces.

According to the Dictionary of the Fungi (10th edition, 2008), there are about 57 species in the genus.In junipers (the primary hosts) (see photo), some species of the fungus form  a ball like gall about 2\u20134 cm in diameter which produces a set of orange tentacle-like spore tubes called telial horns. These horns expand and have a jelly like consistency when wet. In other species the telia  are produced directly from the bark of the juniper with no obvious gall formation or swelling such as in G. clarvariforme . The spores are released and travel on the wind until they infect an apple, pear, or hawthorn tree.\nOn the secondary hosts, the fungus produces yellowish depressions on the leaves. It also infects the fruit, which grows whitish tubes like a Medusa head. These are the spore tubes. The spores must then infect a juniper to complete the life cycle.\nThe fungus does not cause serious damage to junipers, but apple and pear trees can suffer serious loss of fruit production due to the effects of the fungus. Due to the economic impacts of the rusts in some areas where orchards are of commercial importance, some regions have attempted to ban the planting of and/or eradicate the coniferous hosts."

        "GenusSummary": "Cladosporium is a genus of fungi including some of the most common indoor and outdoor molds. Species produce olive-green to brown or black colonies, and have dark-pigmented conidia that are formed in simple or branching chains. Many species of Cladosporium are commonly found on living and dead plant material. Some species are plant pathogens, others parasitize other fungi. Cladosporium spores are wind-dispersed and they are often extremely abundant in outdoor air. Indoors Cladosporium species may grow on surfaces when moisture is present. Cladosporium fulvum, cause of tomato leaf mould, has been an important genetic model, in that the genetics of host resistance are understood. In the 1960s, it was estimated that the genus Cladosporium contained around 500 plant-pathogenic and saprotrophic species, but this number has since been increased to over 772 species. The genus Cladosporium is very closely related to black yeasts in the order Dothideales. Cladosporium species are often highly osmotolerant, growing easily on media containing 10% glucose or 12\u201317% NaCl. They are rarely grown on media containing 24% NaCl or 50% glucose and never isolated from medium with 32% NaCl or greater. Most species have very fragile spore chains, making it extremely difficult to prepare a mount for microscopic observation in which the conidial chains are preserved intact."

Sclerotia initially were mistaken for individual organisms and described as separate species until Louis Ren\u00e9 Tulasne proved in 1853 that sclerotia are only a stage in the life cycle of some fungi. Further investigation showed that this stage appears in many fungi belonging to many diverse groups. Sclerotia are important in the understanding of the life cycle and reproduction of fungi, as a food source, as medicine (for example, ergotamine), and in agricultural blight management.\nExamples of fungi that form sclerotia are ergot (Claviceps purpurea), Polyporus tuberaster, Psilocybe mexicana, Sclerotium delphinii and many species in Sclerotiniaceae.

The most clinically relevant is Saprochaeta capitata, formerly known as Geotrichum capitatum, with most cases occurring in Europe.Saprochaete clavata, formerly known as Geotrichum clavatum, is an uncommon infection that has been associated with sporadic outbreaks. Geotrichum candidum is closely related to Saprochaeta sp., rarely isolated but may cause invasive and disseminated disease with high mortality Yeast-like and mold-like strains have been identified.The most important risk factor for invasive fungal infection related to Geotrichum is severe immunosuppression, especially in hematological malignancies as acute leukemia, associated with profound and prolonged neutropenia.Fungemia is very common, often with deep organ involvement (lung, liver, spleen, and central nervous system) and also skin and mucous membranes lesions. There is no optimal treatment for Geotrichum infections but based on existing data guidelines recommend amphotericin B with or without co-administered flucytosine or with voriconazole showing good in vitro susceptibility.\nMortality associated with Geotrichum-related infections is high, ranging from 57% to 80%.Increasing the knowledge on Geotrichum related invasive fungal infections may improve early diagnosis and adequate treatment of these severe infections.\n\n"

They are found on a wide variety of organic substrates, including \"mature fruits and vegetables\", jellies, syrups, leather, bread, peanuts, and tobacco. They are multicellular. Some Rhizopus species are opportunistic agents of human zygomycosis (fungal infection) and can be fatal. Rhizopus infections may also be a complication of diabetic ketoacidosis. This widespread genus includes at least eight species.\n\nRhizopus species grow as filamentous, branching hyphae that generally lack cross-walls (i.e., they are coenocytic). They reproduce by forming asexual and sexual spores. In asexual reproduction, sporangiospores are produced inside a spherical structure, the sporangium. Sporangia are supported by a large apophysate columella atop a long stalk, the sporangiophore. Sporangiophores arise among distinctive, root-like rhizoids. In sexual reproduction, a dark zygospore is produced at the point where two compatible mycelia fuse. Upon germination, a zygospore produces colonies that are genetically different from either parent.\n\nR. microsporus var. oligosporus is used to make tempeh, a fermented food derived from soybeans.\nR. oryzae is used in the production of alcoholic beverages in parts of Asia and Africa.\nRhizopus stolonifer (black bread mold) causes fruit rot on strawberry, tomato, and sweet potato and used in commercial production of fumaric acid and cortisone.Various species, including R. stolonifer, may cause soft rot in sweet potatoes and Narcissus."

The sexual states (teleomorphs) of Beauveria species, where known, are species of Cordyceps.\nBeauveria species are white entomopathogenic fungi. They form unicellular conidia that are typically hydrophobic and very small. The conidia are formed holoblastically from basally inflated conidiogenous cells. After conidium production, the conidiogenous cell elongates before producing another conidium atop a small denticle (a narrow projection bearing a conidium or sporangium). The result is the formation of a distinctive, slender, zig-zag rachis. Colonies of Beauveria species are typically white or off-white on artificial culture media.\nSpecies of Tritirachium resemble Beauveria species in having a zig-zag conidiogenous cells, but differ in lacking conspicuous denticles and in producing yellow-brown to purple colonies.\nBeauveria species are commonly found associated with insects or habitats supporting insects, including soil and private dwellings. B. bassiana, the most widely known member of this genus, has been developed as a biological pesticide for various insect pests."

Due to difficulties in cultivation, commercial harvesting of wild morels has become a multimillion-dollar industry in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, in particular North America, Turkey, China, the Himalayas, India, and Pakistan, where these highly prized fungi are found in abundance.\nTypified by Morchella esculenta in 1794, the genus has been the source of considerable taxonomical controversy throughout the years, mostly with regard to the number of species involved, with some mycologists recognising as few as three species and others over thirty. Current molecular phylogenetics suggest there might be over seventy species of Morchella worldwide, most of them exhibiting high continental endemism and provincialism.\nThe genus is currently the focus of extensive phylogenetic, biogeographical, taxonomical and nomenclatural studies, and several new species have been described from Australia, Canada, Cyprus, Israel, North America, Spain, and Turkey.\n\n"

They readily cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised people such as AIDS patients.\nThere are 299 species in the genus; they are ubiquitous in the environment and are a natural part of fungal flora almost everywhere. They are normal agents of decay and decomposition. The spores are airborne and found in the soil and water, as well as indoors and on objects. The club-shaped spores are single or form long chains. They can grow thick colonies which are usually green, black, or gray.At least 20% of agricultural spoilage is caused by Alternaria species; most severe losses may reach up to 80% of yield, though. Many human health disorders can be caused by these fungi, which grow on skin and mucous membranes, including on the eyeballs and within the respiratory tract. Allergies are common, but serious infections are rare, except in people with compromised immune systems. However, species of this fungal genus are often prolific producers of a variety of toxic compounds. The effects most of these compounds have on animal and plant health are not well known. Many species of alternaria modify their secondary metabolites by sulfoconjugation, however the role of this process is not yet understood. The terms alternariosis and alternariatoxicosis are used for disorders in humans and animals caused by a fungus in this genus.\nNot all Alternaria species are pests and pathogens; some have shown promise as biocontrol agents against invasive plant species. Some species have also been reported as endophytic microorganisms with highly bioactive metabolites.\nThe genus is now known to be polyphyletic."

        "GenusSummary": "Ascochyta is a genus of ascomycete fungi, containing several species that are pathogenic to plants, particularly cereal crops.  The taxonomy of this genus is still incomplete.  The genus was first described in 1830 by Marie-Anne Libert, who regarded the spores as minute asci and the cell contents as spherical spores. Numerous revisions to the members of the genus and its description were made for the next several years.  Species that are plant pathogenic on cereals include, A. hordei, A. graminea, A. sorghi, A. tritici.  Symptoms are usually elliptical spots that are initially chlorotic and later become a necrotic brown.  Management includes fungicide applications and sanitation of diseased plant tissue debris.\nSome of these pathogens in the genus Ascochyta affect grass species, including grains."

        "GenusSummary": "Amylostereum is the single genus in the fungal family Amylostereaceae. The genus currently comprises four saprotrophic and parasitic species, which live off living or dead wood. The Amylostereaceae cause white rot in the wood by disintegrating the tissue component lignin. They produce crust-like, partially wavy fruit bodies on the surface of infested trees, which are similar to those produced by Stereum species.\nThere are four described species in the Amylostereaceae: A. chailletii (the type), A. areolatum, A. ferreum and A. laevigatum. The species were initially considered part of Stereum until mycologist Jacques Boidin found atypical microscopic differences between them. Forty years after his extensive researches from 1958, Boidin reclassified Amylostereum into its own family.\nThree Amylostereum species are symbionts of wood wasps in the genera Sirex, Urocerus, and Xoanon, which infest conifers. The female wood wasps deposit their eggs together with fungal spores and mucus in trees, and the fungus is eaten by the wasp's larva as food. The fungus propagates vegetatively through the formation of asexual spores in newly emerged females that are stored in special structures adapted for the transport of symbiotic fungi. The A. areolatum\u2013Sirex woodwasp (S. noctilio) symbiont complex has been studied extensively because of its potential to cause substantial economic losses in the forestry industry, particularly in non-native regions."

Species of this genus are usually observed producing zone lines, conidiomata and ascomata on dead fallen leaves, but at least some are known to colonize living leaves. In many cases they then live inside the colonized leaf as a symptomless endobiont, where they are regarded as detritivores utilising dead plant matter. In a few cases they may kill all or part of the leaf prematurely, and there is a substantial literature dealing with those species as plant pathogens. The genus infects many different plant families but with a notable concentration in the family Pinaceae; many Lophodermium species are restricted to a single host genus (or even species), but some, particularly those infecting grasses, may infect several genera. Some are economically important plant pathogens, such as those that cause needlecast disease in European Black Pine, Scots Pine and Red Pine in forestry and christmas tree plantations. In these species, notably L. pinastri and L. seditiosum, the fungal spores disperse and infect the pine needles in late summer, which turn brown by the following spring and then fall off."

It is characterized by the production of conidia within pycnidia. The symptoms include chlorotic spots that turn brown and necrotic. Septoria apiicola can survive on seeds.\nSeveral species of passion flower are infected by several species of Septoria, and a fungus, which has been going by the name Septoria passiflorae but which is probably an undescribed species, has been used to control the invasive Passiflora tarminiana in Hawai'i."

        "GenusSummary": "Cyathus is a genus of fungi in the Nidulariaceae, a family collectively known as the bird's nest fungi. They are given this name since they resemble tiny bird's nests filled with \"eggs\", structures large enough to have been mistaken in the past for seeds. However, these are now known to be reproductive structures containing spores. The \"eggs\", or peridioles, are firmly attached to the inner surface of this fruit body by an elastic cord of mycelia known as a funiculus. The 45 species are widely distributed throughout the world and some are found in most countries, although a few exist in only one or two locales. Cyathus stercoreus is considered endangered in a number of European countries. Species of Cyathus are also known as splash cups, which refers to the fact that falling raindrops can knock the peridioles out of the open-cup fruit body. The internal and external surfaces of this cup may be ridged longitudinally (referred to as plicate or striate); this is one example of a taxonomic characteristic that has traditionally served to distinguish between species.\nGenerally considered inedible, Cyathus species are saprobic, since they obtain nutrients from decomposing organic matter. They usually grow on decaying wood or woody debris, on cow and horse dung, or directly on humus-rich soil. The life cycle of this genus allows it to reproduce both sexually, with meiosis, and asexually via spores. Several Cyathus species produce bioactive compounds, some with medicinal properties, and several lignin-degrading enzymes from the genus may be useful in bioremediation and agriculture. Phylogenetic analysis is providing new insights into the evolutionary relationships between the various species in Cyathus, and has cast doubt on the validity of the older classification systems that are based on traditional taxonomic characteristics"

        "GenusSummary": "The genus Amanita contains about 600 species of agarics including some of the most toxic known mushrooms found worldwide, as well as some well-regarded edible species. This genus is responsible for approximately 95% of the fatalities resulting from mushroom poisoning, with the death cap accounting for about 50% on its own. The most potent toxin present in these mushrooms is amanitin.The genus also contains many edible mushrooms, but mycologists discourage mushroom hunters, other than knowledgeable experts, from selecting any of these for human consumption. Nonetheless, in some cultures, the larger local edible species of Amanita are mainstays of the markets in the local growing season. Samples of this are Amanita zambiana and other fleshy species in central Africa, A. basii and similar species in Mexico, A. caesarea and the 'Blusher' Amanita rubescens in Europe, and A. chepangiana in South-East Asia. Other species are used for colouring sauces, such as the red A. jacksonii with a range from eastern Canada to eastern Mexico.Many species are of unknown edibility, especially in countries such as Australia, where many fungi are little-known."
